# AOC 2022 - Golang implementation

I am trying to learn Golang in an efficient way, so the first days of Advent of Code are a nice playground. Module structure is quick&dirty (everything in a main package), but properly using modules & packages is not the goal here.

To compute the answers for a given day, run :
```bash
go run . --day dayX --path ./data/dayX[-example]
```

For example, to compute the answers for day 2 with the example data located in the data folder :

```
go run . --day day2 --path ./data/day2-example
```
